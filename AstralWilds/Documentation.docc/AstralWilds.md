# AstralWilds

**AstralWilds** is an immersive experience developed for visionOS, centered around space exploration and offering a captivating journey through the solar system.


## Overview

As a solo developed project, AstralWilds is meticulously crafted by a single developer. What began as a demonstration project has evolved into a showcase of personal achievements. From its initial release built and tested exclusively with the visionOS simulator to its latest refinements with the mandatory usage of the device, AstralWilds is built with dedication and innovation.

### The features
AstralWilds delivers a rich and thoughtfully designed feature set, ensuring an engaging and accessible user experience. Key features include:

- **Adaptive Main View:** The main interface is highly responsive to user preferences, allowing adjustments to content size while maintaining optimal element scaling for readability, clarity, and, most importantly, **accessibility**.
- **Reality Composer Pro Integration:** While many functionalities were coded from scratch, some elements were developed using Reality Composer Pro. This approach leverages the framework’s capabilities to achieve effective results efficiently, avoiding unnecessary reinvention.
- **Gesture Controls:** Gestures are a standout feature in visionOS. AstralWilds takes full advantage of this capability by enabling intuitive interactions. For example, with a simple snap of your fingers, you can dismiss an entire immersive space, showcasing how the operating system’s potential can be fully realized.

### Purpose

The project originated as a deliverable for the **Advanced Research Track Experience (ARTE)** program, aiming to secure selection into the initiative. Subsequent development has been driven by the knowledge and skills gained through the program, resulting in a polished and engaging application.

### The plans
AstralWilds has an exciting roadmap for future development. Upcoming enhancements include integrating Apple Intelligence and Siri for a more dynamic and interactive experience.
