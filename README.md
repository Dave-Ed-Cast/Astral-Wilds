This is a VisionOS app that I used for the ARTE project at the Apple Developer Academy

Please do note that this project has been created on May 12nd, therefore this app prototype is very basic, may contain errors due to the fact that all of this was created in 10 days

Everything has been following documentations online and my abilities. The images and sounds used are from either VisionOS or third parties. Under no circumstances i retain copyrights for these two things i mentioned. The only copyright would be only the abilities to implement everything.

Welcome. This VisionOS app is trying to recreate an experience through the solar system in your living room or wherever you have a little bit of space. 
It is imperative to note that the user interface is still a bit unpolished but the idea is how we could recreate the solar system and interact with it.

The app consists of 3 main buttons:

1) Spawn the solar system and just admire it (Do note that you can move around. If you move, you will also see the sun right where you stood earlier)
2) Interact with the solar system so that you can move each planet and stop it at your command.
3) Enjoy the journey through mars to an immersive experience that will leave you breathless

There will be a fully commeneted project and a file dedicated to every portion of the project
